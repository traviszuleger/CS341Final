Similar to READ_ME_COMMENTING.txt, in order to make writing comments easier for you, since it may be tough constantly following them or going back and changing, I created an Eclipse template for you.

The .xml file you may see in the graphics folder is a file that can be imported into Eclipse, then all you
have to do is type one line above a method or class "/**" then press <ENTER> on your keyboard. This will insert the block comment with all of the variables that I have described in the "CONVENTIONS.txt" file.

Here are the instructions for importing this file.

1.) Open Eclipse
2.) Click WINDOW -> PREFERENCES, this should open a new window.
3.) In this window, you should see a menu on the left-hand side, click on the drop-down arrow on JAVA.
4.) Click on Code Style -> Code Templates
5.) Click "import..."
6.) This should open up your File Browser, navigate to the folder that contains the "commenting.xml" that I provided.
7.) Rename this template to whatever you want.
8.) You should now be able to create a 2-star block comment ("/**") and press enter for it to automatically insert the comments that I expected you to add.

If at any time you would like to change this back, follow each step above but instead of importing "commenting.xml", import "original.xml" that I also provide for you.

What changed? Constructors, Regular methods, and Class block comments.
