Similar to READ_ME_COMMENTING.txt, in order to make writing conventions easier for you, since it may be tough constantly following them or going back and changing, I created an Eclipse template for you.

The .xml file you may see in the graphics folder is a file that can be imported into Eclipse, then all you
have to do is hold CTRL + SHIFT + R to reformat the code in that file.

Here are the instructions for importing this file.

1.) Open Eclipse
2.) Click WINDOW -> PREFERENCES, this should open a new window.
3.) In this window, you should see a menu on the left-hand side, click on the drop-down arrow on JAVA.
4.) Click on Code Style -> Formatter (Code templates is misleading and NOT what you want to click here.)
5.) Click "import..."
6.) This should open up your File Browser, navigate to the folder that contains the "conventions.xml" that I provided.
7.) Rename this template to whatever you want.
8.) You should now be able to press CTRL + SHIFT + R on any file of yours to reformat your code to my desired conventions.

If you want to change back at any time, follow the steps up to STEP 4, then click on the Drop-down list to the left of the "Edit..." button and above the "New...", "Import...", "Export All..." button, then click on "Eclipse [built-in]"
